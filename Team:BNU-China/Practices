                <h2>Preface</h2>
                <h3>Why we do this</h3>
                <p>In recent years, cancer has become one of the most serious killers threatening human health.
                    Morbidity and mortality raising continuously, cancer is becoming a primary death reason and a
                    significant public health problem. As is reported by Chinese Cancer Statistics 2015, there will be
                    more than 4 million new cancer cases and nearly 3 million deaths of cancer in 2015. It has become
                    one of the most serious problems facing by China, even globe, to treat cancer effectively. </p>
                <p>Aiming at different kind of cancers, different medicines and treatments have been developed based on
                    different therapy principles. However, the detecting and screening of medicines now is conducted
                    based more on chemical methods, which is sometimes complex and time-consuming. Inspired by the
                    properties of microtubule-stabilizing agent taxol, we developed a method to screen medicines based
                    on the microtubule stabilization. If microtubule-stabilizing molecule exists, our engineered protein
                    will polymerize and show light which can be detected through microscope. We expect it to be a more
                    sensitive and effective system to screen anticancer agents. </p>
                <div id="MINI-iGEM"></div>
                <p>Our Human Practice is based on the project and included interviews, investigations and games we
                    designed.</p>

                <h3>Mini-iGEM</h3>
                <p>We organized the Mini-iGEM competition, which took a month, before our project began. As its name,
                    the competition is for small iGEM projects designed by ten groups. They worked as iGEM's pattern and
                    designed a project or solved a problem using principles of synthetic biology. Then we invited some
                    professors to score these projects and give their advice. Through this competition, we found some
                    inspiring ideas and on the other hand deepened students' understand of iGEM. </p>
                <p>Here are some of posters of Mini-iGEM.</p>

                <h2>Seeing is believing</h2>
                <h3>Investigation of <i>Taxus yunnanensis</i></h3>
                <p>The most famous microtubule-stabilizing medicine is taxol, which comes from extraction of
                    <i>Taxus</i> trees. However, since the great performance in curing cancer was discovered, yew trees
                    in Yunnan have experienced a period of massacre, which caused a sharp decrease in yew population.
                    So, in these years, the government has taken measures to protect them. Then we are wondering whether
                    those measures truly work and how is everything going with yew trees now in Yunnan. So we spend
                    several days this summer in Yunnan investigating the yew trees there. We went to some places
                    including Yunnan Hande Biotechnology Corporation which is the first producing source of taxol in
                    China, Yunnan Acadamy of Forestry (YAF) and Kunming Institute of Botany (KIB), Chinese Academy of
                    Science. Besides, we carried on population survey in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming
                    Botanical Garden.</p>
                <p>From our survey, we learned that there are more and more yew tree plant bases coming into being in
                    Yunnan and they are mainly allocated at sipsongpanna, Wenshan, Diqing, and so on. The distribution
                    of wild yew trees is separated and in small population, for both natural and human reasons. In the
                    YAF, Dr. Jinfeng Zhang and his fellow said that it's important to nurture artificial yew forests,
                    especially from the angle of economy and forestry. The yew trees and its wood are both valuable so
                    the artificial forest is a great protection of wild trees. He said that, the yew trees do have other
                    values in addition to anticancer. For example, it can be used to treat diabetes, skin diseases and
                    sore throat. Besides, its wood is also precious (Though we can't agree with some of what he
                    said.).</p>
                <p>As to planting yew trees, the farmers should get united with enterprises, who can give guide to
                    farmers and ensure the quality of yews. Some farmers just noticed the great profits in planting yew,
                    but had little techniques in it, which caused large loss to them. Besides, these cases was also a
                    waste of soil and resources. As a consequence, governments and companies should actively guide
                    farmers to plant trees, and it’s a win-win choice. </p>
                <p>The protection of wild yew trees goes well in Yunnan province. And the support to scientific research
                    and forestry study from government are strengthened these years. As Dr. Zhang said, government
                    should focus on protection, and leaves the yew market to itself. The public attribute to yew trees
                    and its protection changes a lot among different people. Here is an overview of the public research
                    result.</p>
                <h3>Public research</h3>
                <p>In order to learn about the public attitude and knowledge to yew protection, we carried on a public
                    research in Heilongtan Park, Yunnan University and Kunming Botanical Garden, Kunming.Here is our
                    result.</p>

                <p>Through the random investigation we learned that almost half of residents know some markets selling
                    yew products while tourists know little about this. And after we ask further we noticed that these
                    markets usually distribute in the aggregation place of wild yew trees such as Lijiang.</p>
                <p>Besides, over 90% people thought that there are not many yew trees in the wild and they needed
                    enhanced protection. But when it comes to the present situation of yew protection, the understanding

                <p>The most locals thought that the protecting condition of the yew is unfavorable while people from
                    other provinces argues the opposites. After further study, we learned that there have been cases in
                    Kunming Botany Garden that people skinned the yew for money. And a sizable part of the old took or
                    are taking yew medicines like yew wine and so on. There are also some people collecting yew wood
                    chopping block, cups, and tea table.</p>
                <p>Besides, we learned that the knowledge of yew mainly spread through leisure chatting or learn from
                    families and friends. Some of its information comes from sellers, too. Among people from other
                    provinces, some learned yew from internet or books, and some learned from sellers. So many yew
                    production sellers play an important role in popularization of yew science and the information they
                    provided needs to be standardized.</p>
                <h3>Interview with Hande company</h3>
                <p>Hande Biotechnology Corporation is a mature company with long history. As the first company in China
                    to produce taxol, it drew our attention immediately. They focused more on the profit of taxol
                    products and they are also playing an important role in yew resources protection. They now mainly
                    use yew trees tissue as a resource of products. Once upon a time, they were drew into a dilemma for
                    they were accused of using wild yew trees. The protective law being more and more perfect, this kind
                    of problems will no longer cause a debate. They now have their own planting bases and will develop
                    chemical synthesize method to make the production more profitable.</p>

                <h3>Yunnan academic of forestry</h3>
                <p>The interviews to Dr. Jinfeng Zhang from YAF and Dr. Jie Liu from KIB is mainly from scientific view
                    to argue about exploitation and protection politics of yew. Dr. Zhang said that all the artificial
                    yew forest need professional direct from academics or companies. And the taxol content in yew should
                    reach a criterion, which need chemical methods nowadays to analysis, to ensure the subsequent
                    product rate and quality. Our project can also be used in these analysis and may be more convenient.
                    Dr. Zhang’s view about protecting yew is that artificial forest is so popular that we don’t need to
                    constrain the yew productions in the market. What we should do is protect wild trees and now this
                    work goes generally well. So this market should be left to market itself to be regulated.</p>

                <p id="VOICE-FROM-SOCIETY"> Dr. Liu ‘s talk is mainly about the systematic evolution of <i>Taxus </i>species.
                    He has no idea about why some of <i>Taxus</i> species can produce taxol and how the difference of
                    taxol content in different species evolved. But he gave the phylogenetic relationships among present
                    <i>Taxus </i>species. And this talk makes us more reasonable when think about yews. <i>Taxus </i>is
                    just a kind of the miscellaneous plants in the world and he thought that the natural effect is more
                    important than human activities for he thought about this problem in a further larger time scale. We
                    noticed that though these people are all studying about the same species, they think about it from
                    totally different dimensions. That’s truly inspiring.</p>

                <p>Different anticancer medicines are clinically used in different cases, depending on the condition and
                    illness history of the patient. And taxol, a broad-spectrum medicine targeting on the microtubule,
                    is just a choice for cancer doctors. We wondered how these taxol-like medicine are used clinically
                    and what problems they are facing. We went to PUMCH and get Dr. Yingyi Wang for an interview. </p>
                <p id="prac-CCiC">As he said, taxol is a widely used medicine for many kinds of cancers. But it is the
                    wide-ranging that limits its application. Nowadays, targeted medicines which are initiated with
                    precision medicine have great advantages in treating cancer. In the other hand, taxol treatment is a
                    relative affordable scheme in most cases. From medicine history in a broader scale, small medicine
                    agents like taxol would possibly fade out in several decades and be replaced by targeted medicines
                    like antigen medicine or micro-robot which would have less sife effects and safer. However, our
                    engineered device is still work whenever people want to screen microtubule-stabilizing agents. </p>

                <h2>Communicate in community</h2>
                <h3>CCiC conference</h3>
                <p>During September 1st – September 3th, 2016, CCiC conference was organized and held by Sun Yet-sen
                    university in Guangzhou, China. Our team, BNU-China, had the chance to attend to the conference.
                    During the conference, we introduced our project to the other 26 teams.</p>
                <p>In the conference, each team conducted in-depth communication and exchanged ideas on their own
                    projects. The inspiring spark collided by thoughts and innovation among the teams made the attendees
                    reap substantial benefits. After careful preparation, we showed our project roundly to the whole
                    attendees from the aspects of background, project, design, modeling and human practice. In the
                    meantime, we also held open attitude towards the sincere suggestions and comments from other teams.

                <p id="prac-Orienteering">In the conference, not only did we strengthen the relationship with
                    FAFU-CHINA, but we made many new friends as well. And the communication and mutual learning among
                    the teams provided us with the opportunity to broad our horizon and help us acquaint more people
                    with our project.</p>
                <h2>Orienteering game</h2>
                <h3>What's the game</h3>
                <p>In order to facilitate the communication between the students and to help students to get a deeper
                    understanding of iGEM. We designed and organized an orienteering activity "running of biology" in
                    the campus. The rules of the orienteering are designed to bring our ideas to more people. The
                    destinations were set at several typical buildings in the campus and was named by some
                    representative chemical compound we have used or produced in the experiment, such as alpha protein,
                    beta protein, N terminal of luciferase, c terminal of luciferase and some other organic molecular.
                    The students were divided into several teams to compete with each other. Each team should find their
                    destination by the description written on the task card to get a chemical compound. And then the
                    team will obtain the task card leading to the next destination. The team that uses the less time to
                    collect all the chemical compound will win the game.</p>

                    <p id="feedback-p1">The orienteering is entrusted but full of joy and meanings. To start with, as a
                        freshman who has little impression to the campus, the orienteering makes me feel more familiar
                        to the college. What's more, the seniors in our team is so cute and my teammates is so bright
                        and cheerful. Yesterday, we were strangers passing by each other but today we become a group,
                        running and laughing in the school. At last the seniors took us to visit the laboratory, showing
                        the ideas of iGEM, and I found it is really fascinating. I wish I can join in this group next
                        year.</p>

                    <p id="feedback-p2">How time files! The orienteering has already ended. In this lively morning, we
                        walked through the campus. We visited the stela in BNU, made new friends, looked around the lab
                        and understood the main key of iGEM. We learned a lot today, and the high tech equipment really
                        impressed me! I feel I am getting close to the mysterious scientific research. I hope to become
                        a part of iGEM and helping others.</p>

                        as a sophomore student, I am very curious to iGEM, and I want to know more about it. I have
                        learned the detailed introduction to the laboratory and the project from seniors and get the
                        third place prize. I am happy to participate in this activity! I always want to get a chance to
                        train my laboratory experiment skills and do the experiment in the lab but I didn't find the
                        opportunity to do that, and this is one of the reasons of my participation. Finally thanks for
                        taking the time to further our understanding of iGEM. Happy :)</p>
